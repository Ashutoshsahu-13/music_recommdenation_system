# MUSIC_RECOMMENDATION_SYSTEM

A Music Recommendation System is an application of Data Science that aims to assist users in discovering new and relevant musical content based on their preferences and listening behaviour. Personalized music recommendations have become an essential tool in the digital music landscape, enabling music streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music to offer personalized and engaging experiences to their users.

### How Does a Music Recommendation System Work?
Music Recommendation Systems operate through intricate algorithms that analyze vast amounts of data about users’ musical interactions, such as their listening history, liked tracks, skipped songs, and even explicit user preferences conveyed through ratings or feedback. These data points are instrumental in constructing comprehensive user profiles, delineating individual tastes and preferences.

In the initial phase, the system employs various data preprocessing techniques to cleanse and organize the information efficiently. Subsequently, the system uses recommendation algorithms, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches, to generate music recommendations.

As users continually interact with the system, it accumulates additional data, refining and updating their profiles in real time. Consequently, the recommendations become increasingly precise and aligned with the user’s evolving musical preferences.
### What is Spotify API & How to build a Music Recommendation System using Spotify API?
The Spotify API is a set of rules and protocols provided by Spotify developers. It enables developers to interact with Spotify’s vast music catalogue and collect music-related data. Through the Spotify API, developers can access information such as tracks, albums, artists, playlists, user profiles, and play history, among other features, empowering them to build innovative applications and services that integrate seamlessly with the Spotify platform.

To build a Music Recommendation System using the Spotify API, we are required to collect real-time music data from Spotify. For this task, we need a Spotify developer account to get our credentials from Spotify to access their data.
## Description
The project start with collecting the data from spotify database using API key.for which we need to write the request access token code which provide access token .After collecting the data which check for the null values & and data description .some visualization techniues is used to see the plot.Then calculate the cosine similarity to findout the simliarity between the song.After this write one function which provide recommend song and poster based on the given song.
